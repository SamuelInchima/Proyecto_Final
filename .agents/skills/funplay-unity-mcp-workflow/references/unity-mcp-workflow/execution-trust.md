# Execution Trust And Faithful Verification

Read this for source-backed restoration, risky serialized-reference edits, real input validation, stalled Play Mode or continued work across reloads. This does not authorize changing another project's state, widening exposure, installing dependencies or synthesizing application-ready flags.

## Identity and recovery

Independently match initialize.funplay.context.project_path/project_id to the user's intended project before any mutation. A friendly endpoint name, an open socket or an old screenshot is not proof of identity. Prefer generated project-scoped URLs; legacy URLs require expected_context for writes. Keep project/session/reload identity on evidence and reject stale instance/capture receipts. Context is a misrouting guard, not authentication.

Use the current tools/list and exposed get_tool_capabilities. Distinguish implemented, enabled, exposed and runtime-available backends. Recover prepare_editor/get_task using the original task ID or request_key; honor bounded waits and backoff. Never replay an interrupted arbitrary edit just because the response was lost. If a recovery tool is unavailable, use the exposed exact-state reader or report the blocker, not a guessed hidden route.

## Acceptance layers

Report compilation/import, resource provenance, configured components, API/event dispatch, actual input edges, actual rendered output and end-to-end application behavior separately. Editor ready means import/compile/mode readiness only. Require multiple actual PlayerLoop frame/clock samples; advancing wall time or encoded video frames does not prove gameplay Update advanced. Inspect pause, timeScale, focus and runInBackground without changing them through a status read.

Select strict input_route when fidelity matters. UI EventSystem dispatch, direct Button.onClick and physics messages are distinct test paths, not legacy UnityEngine.Input injection. Unsupported legacy polling must be reported. New Input System synthetic input must show Down/Held/Up on distinct real PlayerLoop frames; even those edges do not prove the application's handler accepted the action. Never patch gameplay input or fabricate focus/SDK-ready/outcome state to make a test pass.

## Recoverable C# execution and result delivery

Use specialized tools first. When a project-specific gap needs execute_code, give that logical operation a unique request_key and retain data.task.task_id (execution:<id>). Admission durably records an ID before scheduling Unity code. A keyed short job can return its result within wait_seconds (default 2, 0..30); unkeyed MCP starts return the receipt first. The snippet still runs on Unity's main thread, never a pool thread. Cached execution status can be read while that thread is busy.

After a lost response use get_task(kind=execution, request_key=<original>) or the original task ID. Identical retained keys do not run again; changed code/settings/context conflict. Reload/restart never replays arbitrary code: interrupted preparation reports not_executed, an interrupted body reports outcome_unknown, and confirmed return remains returned even if delivery was interrupted. Revalidate current project/process context and read the actual saved asset/object state before deciding on a NEW operation. A journal receipt is not a business transaction, global actor lock, rollback or power-loss exactly-once guarantee. Do not delete Library/journal files to bypass protection. replay_execute_code explicitly starts a new logical operation, not recovery.

Separate result_success, execution_status/executed, serialization_status and the success of the status query. Vector/Color/Quaternion and other supported Unity values are emitted as finite field-only JSON; Unity object references are bounded identities, not recursive scene graphs. Cycles, excessive depth/non-finite values or output over 8 MiB return explicit RESULT_SERIALIZATION_FAILED/RESULT_TOO_LARGE with execution/recovery metadata. The operation may already have saved a prefab. Never replace failed output with ToString or repeat the write to recover missing data.

Results over 16 KiB become immutable SHA256 snapshots. Read get_task(result_format=items, result_path=/data/returnValue/rows, offset=0, limit=100), then use result_page.next_offset. Paths are JSON Pointers, not C# expressions/JSONPath. An oversized single item requires a narrower pointer or result_format=text; text offsets are UTF-16 code units, so always use next_offset to avoid splitting surrogate pairs. Each content page is capped at 16 KiB. Verify the same result SHA256 across pages; changed/missing files are errors, not permission to regenerate by replaying. Summary reads disclose whether the hash was checked; expired or evicted data is not available indefinitely.

Storage is project-local Library/FunplayMcp/Executions: 32 MiB payload quota, 128 receipts, 24-hour retention and 4096 protected keyed receipts/tombstones. Writes/explicit cleanup perform retention work; read-only get_task never deletes, cancels, forgets keys or changes Unity state. An evicted receipt's key remains protected. On capacity exhaustion stop and request operator review. execute_code(action=cleanup, task_id=...) removes only an unchanged owned terminal result; it does not undo Unity edits. Full-only action=forget plus confirm_forget=true deliberately removes retry protection and can allow another execution; never do this automatically to recover an error. A changed cached file is preserved for review.

Distinguish response wait (wait_seconds), cooperative preparation budget (timeout_seconds, 5..900), and transport deadlines (direct HTTP 60 seconds, broker/client 300 seconds, wrapper default 120 seconds/configurable). Ending a wait/disconnecting is not cancellation. Explicit action=cancel works only before user code begins; synchronous Unity calls cannot be force-stopped, and an over-budget completed write is still a completed write. Use phase timings/UTF8 byte counts and current Editor evidence to diagnose latency, not payload size alone. Optional get_task(include_diagnostics=true) for execution/input exposes bounded stage/type/method identities, without raw source paths, arguments or unsanitized stack text. Keep device ownership and cleanup_verified/cleanup_pending separate from input delivery or application acceptance.

## Legacy input projects and simulation

- Inspect the installed `com.unity.inputsystem` package, active backends, actual input consumer and EventSystem module before recommending a change. An ordinary uGUI click via `simulate_mouse_click(input_route=ui_eventsystem)` may already work without changing backends; use it when handler dispatch is the intended test.
- If a legacy-input-only project needs `simulate_mouse_click(input_route=new_input_system)` or `simulate_mouse_drag`, recommend **Both** rather than disabling legacy support. With user approval, use `Edit > Project Settings > Player > Active Input Handling = Both` and ensure a compatible Input System package is installed. Preserve unsaved work before the required Editor restart; reconnect MCP, reverify project/process identity, and wait for package/import/compile readiness before retesting. Installing dependencies, changing settings and restarting are not authorized merely by asking to inspect UI.
- Both enables two backends, not a bridge between them. Synthetic New Input System devices do not feed `UnityEngine.Input.GetMouseButton*`, `GetTouch` or legacy-only third-party input. Preserve the existing EventSystem/module and bindings; do not automatically replace `StandaloneInputModule`, stack active UI input modules, re-pair `PlayerInput` or migrate gameplay code. Verify that the intended New Input System consumer accepts the device, that Dynamic updates and real PlayerLoop frames advance, and that focus policies allow input. Report an unsupported legacy polling test rather than claiming that Both fixes it.

See [Unity Input System installation and backend activation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.7/manual/Installation.html); check the installed Unity/package version before applying setup instructions.

## Background execution and input

- When verification needs the Unity game to continue while another application is foreground, recommend `Edit > Project Settings > Player > Run In Background`, where available for the installed version/platform. Enabling this persistent default (`PlayerSettings.runInBackground`) requires user approval; inspect the runtime `Application.runInBackground` separately because game code can override it. This is not a guarantee of mobile background execution.
- Do not diagnose an unfocused Editor from that checkbox alone: Unity's Input System documentation treats background execution as already enabled in the Editor. Verify real PlayerLoop frame progression, pause state and the actual device/consumer. Inspect `Input System Package > Background Behavior` and `Play Mode Input Behavior`: devices may still be reset, disabled or routed away from Game View when focus is lost. Changing these policies can affect normal game/Editor input; do not automatically set Ignore Focus or route every device to Game View. A running loop does not prove a click/drag reached the application.
- Distinguish a permanent project preference from an explicitly authorized temporary test. When exposed, `verification_scope(allow_background=true)` can own a temporary runtime flag; end that scope and inspect cleanup/restoration instead of leaving a test-only override behind. It does not change Input System focus policies. Status reads must never enable background execution, steal focus or unpause the game.

See [PlayerSettings.runInBackground](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerSettings-runInBackground.html), [Application.runInBackground and platform limits](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-runInBackground.html), and [Input System background/focus settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.7/manual/Settings.html#background-behavior).

## Owned verification and resources

Use the actual authored scene and real camera. When exposed, verification_scope manages explicitly enrolled jobs and an explicitly requested temporary background flag, with a bounded deadline and compare-before-restore cleanup. End explicitly; inspect cleanup_pending and native job status. A read-only get_task never cleans, cancels, restores or clears dirty state. A scope does not roll back business data, network effects, arbitrary callbacks or user scene edits. Stop actual producers before taking final state; do not clear flags to simulate disposal.

For unresolved serialized references, distinguish missing scripts from unresolved GUID/fileID slots. Before a selective asset write, capture the exact file hash and persistent IDs. Prefer patch_serialized_reference for one ObjectReference change when available: disposable-copy preflight, untouched PPtr comparison and post-import readback must pass before accepting a live save. Ambiguous/unsupported serialization must fail closed. Exact-byte recovery cannot undo arbitrary serialization callback side effects; inspect rollback_verified, backup_path and cleanup_pending. Never text-patch Unity YAML to repair a live graph.

For visual defects, inspect_render_bindings traces the real runtime instance/prefab override through shared material slots, particle trails, shaders and textures plus camera/canvas/mask context. Do not instantiate Renderer.material during inspection. Shader.isSupported and a fixture overlay are not rendered acceptance. Work in coherent code/resource/render batches, preserve original correct assets, and compare the actual scene output after each batch.

## Evidence and continuation

Review finalized videos with their real presentation timestamps, geometry and source hash. If Unity's decoder is unavailable, use already-installed ffmpeg only with explicit external-decoder opt-in; do not install software or change Play state just to decode. Extracted historical frames cannot be used as current click captures.

When exposed, save_verification_evidence/read_verification_evidence reuse static inventories only after file/meta/import-dependency/configuration hashes match. Checkpoints record caller-authored next steps, blockers and unverified layers, not independently verified acceptance. Always refresh runtime/frame/input/application observations. A changed input or incomplete scan invalidates the relevant claim; do not rescan unrelated unchanged resources merely to restate old evidence.

A confirmed blocking native Unity modal that MCP cannot handle may use computer use for that modal only. Explain the blocker first; preserve save/discard/overwrite/install/security authorization boundaries. Then return to MCP, recheck identity/state and read back the interrupted operation. A temporary disconnection alone is not a reason to switch methods.

## Source boundaries

Original Funplay guidance derived from local restoration evidence and public Unity API behavior. Official plugin compatibility provenance remains pinned at cf6b2da24e424b0a60d560a57f39f676cb6f79f3; no third-party skill prose or scripts are copied.
